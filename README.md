This is calconv, a program to convert between various calendars. It's my first real program, started in order to teach myself Python when I had downtime during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.

REQUIREMENTS

To run calconv, you must have the Python programming language and the Tkinter toolkit installed. If you're running a Unix or Unix-like operating system, they probably came with your OS. If not, they should be available through your package manager (called an "app store" on Mac and Windows). If you can't find it in your package manager, you can download it from the following link:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/

RUNNING

From the command line, navigate to the folder where you unpacked the program and type:

./calconv0.6.py

On Windows, you can instead double-click on calconv.bat
